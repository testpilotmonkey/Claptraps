These are BBC Micro disk files to be run in an emulator. They are designed for the game ‘Repton Around the World in 40 Screens’

How to run:

Load up a BBC Micro emulator (I find BeebEm 4 works the best)
Load Repton Around the World disc and boot it.
Choose the Game option.
Load the "Axolotl.ssd" disc.
On the menu screen press L to load levels.
Type "AXOLOTL".
It may say "not found" here, if so try typing "$.AXOLOTL". 

If you have any issues with running the files, please get in touch.
