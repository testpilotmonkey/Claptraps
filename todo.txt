more levels


(search for TODO)
CHECK: apples can't fall into transporters, but can be pushed?

ADD: maybe pass mapgrid[i][j] into functions as 'self' and assign a self.x and self.y to
tidy up code

FIX?: should I put transport function in sketch.js?

FIX?: itemProperties/playerProperties passed to hit function, not object from mapgrid

FIX: item actions are done every frame, even when something is moving

FIX?: should playerProperties.state be in items.js and modified by a Dave object action function?
(if dave is moving or moved, set .state.startleFrog to true)

FIX: maybe pass mapgrid[i][j] into action/hit/etc function as 'self' and create mapgrid[i][j].x
and mapgrid[i][j].y variables

FIX?:(maybe call checkSquash for any time an object wants to move?)

FIX: save button can save multiple times per press

FIX: remove target when new items placed in editor, (& during gameplay)

FIX: change function should check .beingMovedInto, otherwise it may create 2 items instead of 1
or should it create a moving item? (it probably should)

FIX?: problems if checkSquash is defined, but .squash is set in move(). .squash may not be read

FIX: change up/down/left/right to compass directions

FIX: less global variables (i & j should not be global variables)

CHECK: do I need to set temp variables in moveItems, isn't this info in 'hitItem'?

CHECK: do i need .solidToRedFrog now that .isDave exists?
CHECK: do I need most of what is in playerProperties now .isDave exists?

CHECK: do I need this.collect?

CHECK: if item created on beingMovedInto, erase original & call hit????

CHECK: 'mapgrid[xdiff][ydiff].moved = tempDir' after 'createItem(i, j, 0, false)'' in moveItems
because otherwise .moved gets copied over. why do .anim_timer, .anim_frame and .sprite still work?

Extra:

look function maybe shouldn't return playerProperties OR itemProperties, but both?
(kind of implemented already)
(and independent objects when implemented)

probably don't need getProperty function any more

problems with multiple things moving into same space
(eg, if an apple is squashing a frog, and a smiley tries to hit the frog, what will happen?)

implement obj_names to create objects by their name instead of a number

Extra extra:
Array for independent objects (spirits that can go through other spirits/dirt/etc)

two layers

instead of just hpush vpush, npush/epush/spush/wpush

NOTE:

.squash is just used for pushing items (and making sure squares being moved into don't get multiple
objects trying to move into the square(should this maybe use beingMovedInto instead?))
.solid is just used for player movement
(.solid means Dave can't move into the square, .squash means other items can't move into square?)
